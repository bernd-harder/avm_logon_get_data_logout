# avm_logon_get_data_logout

This is a python script to demonstrate how to use the web services provided through the http api of an AVM fritz!box.
It logs on to the box, retrieves some data from a smarthome device connected to it and logs out again.

The code for the logon process is mostly copied from the [this AVM documentation](https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AVM%20Technical%20Note%20-%20Session%20ID_EN%20-%20Nov2020.pdf).
More information about the AVM HTTP api can be found in [this AVM documentation](https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AHA-HTTP-Interface.pdf).
