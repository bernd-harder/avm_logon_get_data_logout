# avm_logon_get_data_logout

This is just a little python code snippet to demonstrate how to use the web services provided through the http api of an AVM fritz!box.
It logs on to the box, retrieves some data from a smarthome device connected to it and logs out again.

The code for the logon process is mostly copied from the [this AVM documentation](https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AVM%20Technical%20Note%20-%20Session%20ID_EN%20-%20Nov2020.pdf).
